In this course I got the oppurtunity to learn about a large number of stuff regarding DevOps. I realized that DevOps is not just about tools and technologies rather it also inculdes the work/company culture associated with it. CAMS model (Culture, Automation, Measurement, and Sharing) constitutes one of the major models of devOps. Culture, Automation, Measurement, and Sharing (CAMS) constitute the integral aspects of DevOps. 

The culture in the CAMS model indicates the work culture a company has, that is based on self-improvement. If the comapny doesnt have such a culture it will be difficult to automate even with the help of tools and technologies. Hence culture is an integral part of CAMS model. 

DevOps process answers the question, how do I get a new feature, a new idea or an enhancement request quickly to production so that I can receive feedback as quickly as possible when it gets to the end users (plus make lots of money as quickly as possible :wink:). The feedback is used to improve the efficiency and performance of the shipped software. 

This requires  a lot of automation. We acheive this through DevOps pipeline, which consists of Continious Integration (CI) with large number of unit tests, followed by Continious Delivery (CD). The pipeline is repeatable, stable, and continious to improve stable and quick application delivery. An example process in this pipeline can be as follows:

- The developer writes code and and commits to distributed content versioning system such as Git
- The commit triggers the build in the CI server (Travis CI)
- The CI server creates artefacts that needs to be deployed for testing
- Unit tests, Functional tests and System tests are done on the new build
- If the build or tests fail, the CI server alerts the developement team.
- If build passes forwarded to continious delivery for automatic deployement.

Other than main concepts about DevOps, I had the oppurtunity of learning the following concepts, tools, and techniques:

- Web developement using hugo
- Version control git
- Continious Integration using TravisCI 
- Continious Deployement using Github pages

I didn't feel any of the stuff in the course was challenging. It was a breeze. :smile:
