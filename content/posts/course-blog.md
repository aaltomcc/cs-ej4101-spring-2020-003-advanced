My motivations for joining this course is listed below (:point_down:):

- I love Mobile Cloud Computing and DevOps (:blue_heart:).
	- I always wanted to get to know more about this but never got an oppurtunity. 	 
- I like to automate all kinds of process
	- Especially software developement and operations process
- I want to be productive
	- I want to quickly produce the outputs and make sure it quickly gets tested and deployed.
- I want to quickly produce outputs
- Professor Mario Di Francesco is teaching the course. He is one of the best teachers from whom I have ever learned. It is an honour to take his courses.
- All the major corporations and enterprises are using DevOps, hence it is essential to know master it.
- This course would provide me with extra tools for the Mobile Cloud Computing course.

My expectations from this course are as follows:

- I will learn about DevOps
- I will learn about Continious Integration (CI)
- I will learn about Continious Developement (CD)
- I will be able to develop and publish tools using the CI/CD pipeline
- I can hopefully have shorter developement cycles with faster innovation. This would result in
	- The time for developement will reduce
	- The time for deployement will reduce
	- Feedback loop would improve the reliability
	- Unit testing with CI/CD and deployement improves reliability
	- Low failures, rollbacks, and mean time to recover
- A non time consuming course that is easy to follow but would provide with the theorotical as well as practical knowledge to do DevOps.

Hopefully I will learn a bunch of stuff. Fingers crossed. :smile:
