I am a Doctoral candidate at the Department of Computer Science, Aalto University, Finland. My research interests include distributed computing at network edge, fog networks, and high performance computing.

Currently I work under [Prof. Mario Di Francesco](https://users.aalto.fi/~difram1/). Earlier, I worked with [Prof. Rashid Mehmood](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/rashid-mehmood-87b841) and [Dr. Riaz Sheikh](https://sites.google.com/site/riaz289/).

Some of my responsibilities include,

- Developed a framework to improve the Quality of Service (QoS) of networked healthcare services based on edge-computing paradigms, using Deep Learning and soft computing techniques.
- Created fault-tolerant routing algorithms for IoT and Wireless Sensor Networks to enable reliable and resilient smart city applications.
- Developed a tool named SURAA to enable load-balanced execution of sparse matrix-vector product on GPUs with the help of CUDA Dynamic Parallelism.
